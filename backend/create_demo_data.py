# Quantum Physics Principles

## Wave-Particle Duality
Light and matter exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties depending on how they are observed.

## Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
It is impossible to simultaneously know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision.

## Quantum Superposition
A quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured.

## Quantum Entanglement
Two or more particles can become correlated in such a way that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently.

- **Immutability**: Data cannot be changed after creation
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take/return functions
- **Composition**: Combining functions to create new ones

## JavaScript Functional Features
```javascript
// Array methods
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);
const evens = numbers.filter(n => n % 2 === 0);
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0);

// Function composition
const compose = (...fns) => x => fns.reduceRight((y, f) => f(y), x);
const addOne = x => x + 1;
const multiplyByTwo = x => x * 2;
const addOneThenDouble = compose(multiplyByTwo, addOne);
